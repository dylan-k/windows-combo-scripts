Combo Scripts: Multi-launchers and Utility Routines for Windows

The start menu isn't enough for me. It only opens shortcuts to apps. The search, various launchers, mostly they just run shortcuts too. Sometimes you need to do a combination of things. It's a computer, after all.

These are scripts to do some more complex things like "setup the desktop to begin a writing session" or "open several apps together and close them together when I'm done". This saves me so much time overall and helps me switch tasks more easily.

Combined with Shortcuts and Scheduled Tasks, these scripts make Windows a lot more flexible and customized for me. They're mostly combo-launchers but there are some backup, maintenance , and cleanup routines in here as well.
